# Pulsar

The bedrock application for using the [Magnetar](https://github.com/pyxol/magnetar) framework.

### About Magnetar
Magnetar is a robust PHP framework for creating highly scalable, blazing fast web apps. The framework utilizes [dependency injection](https://php-di.org/doc/understanding-di.html) and a DI container by way of an application layer with an interchangeable kernel for multi-interface use. [Facades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) provide easy access to common functionality like databases and configuration. The framework also provides foundational logic for HTTP routing, multiple database adaptors, templating, cache, and more.

### Getting Started

3. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-macos) if needed
4. Install the framework using either `composer install` or `php composer.phar install` depending on your environment.
